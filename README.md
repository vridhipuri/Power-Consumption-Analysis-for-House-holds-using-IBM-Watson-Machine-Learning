Power-Consumption-Analysis-for-House-holds-using-IBM-Watson-Machine-Learning

To achieve reduction in electricity consumption, it is vital to have current information about household electricity use. This project mainly focuses on applying a machine-learning algorithm to calculate the power consumed by all appliances. This will help you track the power consumed on regular intervals for all kinds of appliances which use heavy loads such as Air Conditioners, Oven or a washing machine etc.
A regression algorithm such as Linear Regression algorithm is used here. The data is trained and tested. From this best model is selected and saved in .pkl format. The model is integrated with flask and is deployed on IBM Watson Studio.
